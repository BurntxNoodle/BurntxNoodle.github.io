title: Attack Paths and Commands
---

# ðŸš§ Project in progress ðŸš§

## What is this page?

This page will contain a high-level overview of general attack paths/vectors that I've encountered from activities such as HackTheBox and VulnHub. Additionally, this page will have a checklist of commands that maps out to each of its respective attack path. For ease of use and organization, each of the attack paths and their commands are organized based on the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.

## Reconnaissance and Enumeration

* [General nmap scan]()
* [Nmap scan for all ports]()
* [General zenmap scan]()
* [Using gobuster to brute-force URIs]()
* [Using dirb to brute-force URIs]()
* [Using dirbuster to brute-force URIs]()
* [Using wfuzz to fuzz potential files]()
* [Using wfuzz to fuzz subdomains]()
