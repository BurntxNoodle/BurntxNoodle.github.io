## What is Burp Suite?
Burp Suite (also referred to as just "Burp") is a popular penetration testing tool which is often used for gathering information about web applications. This tool is meant to be used hands-on as the user controls the actions that are performed, mainly the ability to pass HTTP requests between the Burp tools in order to accomplish specific tasks that are relevant to the penetration test. There are several sub tools within Burp such as Scanner, Intruder, Decoder, and Comparer. However one of particular interest is the Repeater tool which is used to manually modify and HTTP requests.
