## About Me
I'm currently a student studying Computer Science with an interest in information security: Red Teaming/Pentesting, Digital Forensics/Incident Response, and Exploit Development. 

I learn by doing hands-on activities such as CTFs so you can find write-ups for CTF challenges and HackTheBox challenges in here. Doing write-ups helps me remember what I learn and it ensures that I fully understand the topic. Documenting what I learn also helps me share what I learned that might be useful to others.
