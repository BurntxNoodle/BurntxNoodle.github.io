Blue is a very simplistic machine to exploit which highlights the seriousness of the EternalBlue exploit (thus the name of this challenge). Reading about it [here on the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue) I learned that EternalBlue was used in widespread attacks such as the WannaCry ransomeware attack in 2017. Due to the way SMBv1 in multiple versions of Microsoft Windows handles specifically crafted packets from this attack, it allows remote code execution on the target computer.
