title: HackTheBox Lame
---

HTB Lame is a starter level machine that can be easily exploited using metasploit and some googling. Samba SMB (server message block) is a vulnerable process that in this challenge, was used to get root access into the machine using a metasploit module. To exploit this box, you just need to know basic enumeration, linux services, and some googling.
