title: Analyzing network traffic (PCAP file) with Wireshark - HackTheBox Chase (Forensics Challenge) Writeup
---

Chase is a HackTheBox challenge that is under their forensics list. For the challenge you are given a `.pcapng` (PCAP Next Generation) file in which you are to find if any malicious activity were present. Analyzing the conversation would result in finding malicious activity and an interesting `.txt` file which ends up being the flag in an encoded format.

Most of my experience prior to this was pentesting mainly with the HackTheBox machines, and thus having extremely limited exposure to PCAP analysis and Wireshark; so I decided to do this challenge! Having previous pentesting experience facilitated in having a complete understanding of what the attacker was doing such as uploading webshells, getting a reverse shell, etc. To learn, I decided to go pretty in depth with the analysis (and especially with this writeup) to make the most out of this challenge.
