Netmon teaches about vulnerabiities associated with the PRTG Network Monitor. Exploiting this box requires some enumeration knowledge of windows, FTP, some knowledge of PRTG network monitor (lots of googling was done during this challenge), and a little bit of knowledge of powershell. In the method that I used to exploit netmon (that will be shown on this writeup), I also used (and learned how to use by doing this challenge) SimpleHTTPServer on kali linux.
