title: HackTheBox Bashed Writeup
---

Bashed is an easy-medium level machine from HackTheBox. In this writeup I use dirbuster to look at directories and file names within the website. Knowledge of basic enumeration, and Linux systems should be known; by doing this machine, I learned how to create reverse shells, how to transfer files between an attacker's/victim's machine, and how webshells work.
