title: AttackPathsAndCommands Page Started
---

Under `Offensive Security - Home` → `Attack Paths & Commands` I added the new link to a mini-project that I have started. As the title suggests, this page mainly contains a list of commands that were used in different segments of the MITRE ATT&CK framework while I was doing CTFs/Wargames/HackTheBox/VulnHub. So far the initial Recon/Enumeration commands list is mostly done, will be updating this mini side project everyday.

View the new page in the side bar ☰ on the top left or by clicking [here](https://securitynoodle.github.io/RedTeam/AttackPathsAndCommands/).
