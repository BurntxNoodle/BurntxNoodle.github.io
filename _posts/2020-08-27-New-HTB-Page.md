title: New HackTheBox Writeup Page
---

In the menu sidebar â˜°, I added the link to the new webpage I've been working on to serve as a place where all my HackTheBox writeups can easily be found. [Click here](https://securitynoodle.github.io/HackTheBox/) to view the new page. 

The list of writeups are in alphabetical order to facilitate finding specific challenges to read up on. I have also included a general difficulty rating that's based on the user-rated scale on HackTheBox's website so readers can get an idea of the level of complexity associated with each of the writeups.
