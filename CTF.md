## What are CTFs
Capture the Flags (CTFs) are (mostly) online competitions meant for cybersecurity individuals of all experience levels - from beginner to professional. Competitors can team up or compete individually depending on the competition's rule set. There are two common CTF types:

* Jeopardy-Style: As the name suggests, the formatting of this CTF competition is based off Jeopardy: there are multiple categories which are usually Reverse Engineering (RE), Binary Exploitation (sometimes referred to as `Pwn`), Web Exploitation, Cryptography, and Forensics. Within each category, there are multiple challenges worth different amounts of points - the higher the point value, the harder the challenge is (usually). The team with the most points with the competition!
* Attack-Defend: This CTF competition is an event where each team attacks other team's systems while simultanously defending their own. "Flags" in the form of text files, folders, and sometimes images are placed around both systems for the opposing to exploit their way to. Sometimes this CTF can be divided up into two rounds, where the first round is one team attack while the other defends and the second round swaps the roles. 
* Wargames: Wargames are kind of their own thing - described below.

## What are Wargames
Wargames usually have one theme/objective to learn that include several challenges that increases in difficulty as one progresses. Wargames can be about something as general as linux commands (such as [OverTheWire - Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) or more advanced with binary exploitation challenges. Most wargames I have encountered don't have a time limit whereas CTFs will run for a weekend usually. 

## Other CTF Writeups
